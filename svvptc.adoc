// Preamble

====
Change is extremely unlikely. A high threshold will be used, and a change will
only occur because of some truly critical issue being identified during the
public review cycle. Any other desired or needed changes can be the subject of a
follow-on new extension.

== Eliding Memory-Management Fences on Making PTEs Valid (Svvptc)

When the Svvptc extension is implemented, explicit stores that update the Valid
bit of leaf and/or non-leaf PTEs from 0 to 1 and are visible to a hart will
eventually become visible within a bounded timeframe to subsequent implicit
accesses by that hart to such PTEs.

[NOTE]
====
Typically, PTEs are marked as Valid by the operating system following a
page-fault exception or during system calls for memory mapping. In such cases,
the trap handler commonly employs an `SRET` instruction to return from the trap.
When Svvptc is implemented, the stores it executes to change the Valid bit
of the PTEs from 0 to 1 then become visible to implicit references to those PTEs
within a bounded timeframe. This visibility pertains to the instructions like
the one causing the page-fault or those accessing new memory regions. A
memory-management fence can be used to force immediate visibility of these PTE
updates to all implicit references associated with instructions following the
memory-management fence. However, when Svvptc is implemented, visibility (in a
bounded amount of time) is guaranteed and use of a memory-management fence is
not required in these scenarios. While this approach might lead to an occasional
gratuitous page-fault, the performance benefit of omitting the memory-management
fence instructions outweighs the occasional cost of a gratuitous page-fault.
