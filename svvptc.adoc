== Eliding Memory-Management Fences on Making PTEs Valid (Svvptc)

When the Svvptc extension is implemented, explicit stores within a hart that
update the Valid bit of leaf or non-leaf PTEs from 0 to 1 will eventually become
visible to implicit references in that hart to the memory-management data
structures. This visibility is immediate for instructions following a
memory-management fence instruction that orders the preceding explicit stores.
Otherwise these stores become visible within a bounded timeframe to implicit
references made by subsequent instructions.

[NOTE]
====
Typically, PTEs are marked as Valid by the operating system following a
page-fault exception or during system calls for memory mapping. In cases like
these, the trap handler usually employs an `SRET` instruction to return from the
trap. The stores it executes to change the Valid bit of the PTEs from 0 to 1
then become visible to implicit references in that hart to such PTEs within a
bounded timeframe. This is applicable for instructions like the one causing the
page-fault or those accessing new memory regions. In these scenarios, a
memory-management fence is not required. While this approach might lead to an
occasional gratuitous page-fault, the performance benefit of omitting the
memory-management fence instructions outweighs the occasional cost of a
gratuitous page-fault.
